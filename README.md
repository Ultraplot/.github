Hi there,

Welcome to UltraPlot, a succint wrapper to matplotlib for producing beautiful plots.

# Why Code More When You Can Code Less?
It's UltraPlots mission to make plotting as easy as possible. We believe that the less code you have to write, create or design intricate plots. We do this by expanding the workhorse of scientific plotting -- matplotlib -- and set sensible defaults to produce beautiful plots. Furthermore, we modify the syntax to make plotting complicated plots are breeze. This way, you can focus on the data and the story you want to tell.

Have a look around and explore our [docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ultraplot/badge/?version=latest).

# Installation

``` bash
pip install ultraplot
conda install ultraplot

It's that simple!
